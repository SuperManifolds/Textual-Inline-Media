# Textual Inline Media Plugin
**Extension to enhance the inline media features of Textual IRC Client**
   
This is an extension for [Textual IRC Client](https://codeux.com/) that enhances it by adding various meta-information to messages that contain links. It will display tweets, wikipedia articles, youtube video information, and the title and description of every webpage + more!   
    
This extension is currently in beta. I take no responsibility for crashes or instability resulting from using this extension, however I encourage anyone to report issues they encounter in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/xlexi/Textual-Inline-Media/issues).

[The binary downloads for this extension is available here](http://xlexi.github.io/Textual-Inline-Media/)
